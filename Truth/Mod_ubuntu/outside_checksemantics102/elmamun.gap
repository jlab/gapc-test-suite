elmamun.gap:185.1-19: The minimal yield size of your grammar 'gra_elmamun' is 1, i.e. it cannot parse the empty input string ''. For outside grammar generation, this means you are lacking a recursion basis which will result in empty results for ALL outside candidates! Try adding an alternative like nil(EMPTY) to your axiom.
