How to run tests and install gapc on diverse architectures:

- First, you have to install all dependencies, e.g. boost, bison, ... have a look at INSTALL.cebitec_*
- If you read this file, you already cloned the test-suite repository. To automatically run the tests for gapc type
	bash run.sh *** notimestamp
  where *** is the configuration file you want to use from the repository "main" subdirectory "config". E.g. for CeBiTec machine "waldorf", which has a solaris architecture. use "cebitec_solarisgcc" (without the .mf)
  The "main" repository of gapc will automatically be cloned and saved under "workdir_***".
- If the run.sh returns without an error message (a detailed log is in subdir "log") everything is OK, you are ready to install gapc.
- for installation, change to the "workdir_***" and type "make install"
